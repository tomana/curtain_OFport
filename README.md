curtain_OFport
==============

Port of Curtain for processing by Jared Counts, see http://bluethen.com/wordpress/ and his OpenProcessing sketch
http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/20140

Description
----
Simple yet really responsive and dynamic, with a relatively flexible implementation. Most of the functionality(not keyboard) and brilliant comments from Jared Counts original implementation are kept. Some cheap and dirty code w.r.t. mouse input.
